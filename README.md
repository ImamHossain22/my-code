### Understanding Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript's type system provides powerful tools that help you write safer, more maintainable code. Among the most useful features are union types and intersection types—both of which allow you to express more flexible and precise data structures.

### Union Types: Flexibility in Your Code

A union type allows a value to be one of several possible types. It’s useful when a variable or function can accept multiple types of data. This flexibility ensures that TypeScript enforces type safety, even with different type possibilities.

### Intersection Types: Combining Multiple Types
An intersection type combines multiple types into one. A value of an intersection type must satisfy all the types it intersects. It’s ideal when you need to combine properties from different types or interfaces into one.

 **When to Use Each?**
Union types are great when a variable can be one of several types (e.g., string or number).
Intersection types are best when a value needs to have the properties of multiple types simultaneously (e.g., combining Person and Employee).

**Why They Matter**
# Type Safety: 
Both types improve type safety by ensuring your values conform to the expected structure.

# Readability: 
Union and intersection types make your code more predictable and self-documenting.
# Maintainability: 

They help manage complex types and create more flexible code that’s easier to scale.
